        <h2>Why Did I Choose Coding?</h2>
            <p>I first learned about coding in middle school. There was an opportunity open for kids who wanted to code and my teacher insisted we test out
                the app that the program would use. I found it interesting and fun, but at the time, I was more into books than games. Fast-forward a couple years later 
                and I was left wondering what I would be studying. My childhood dream of working at a zoo didn't seem so appealing anymore and going into anything
                too routine seemed like it would drive me crazy in the first year. Settling on going into the healthcare system, I began looking through 
                different majors just in case something called out to me. And sure enough, there was coding. 12-year old me pointed saying, "That's what we're
                going to do." I did my proper research, learning about the various creating and thinking aspects and I was sold. Now, I'm happy to have found something
                that'll satisfy my inner creative child and nerd.
