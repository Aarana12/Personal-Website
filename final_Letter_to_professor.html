        <h1>Hello Professor Hamachi!</h1>
        <p>
            I know it isn't much, but I have decided to dedicate a section for you, at least
            temporarily, to give you my thanks. To be completely honest, writing this makes me feel a lot like
            those preschoolers that give poorly-made drawings as a gift but this is my first website ever
            (and those drawings are the only ones that get tacked to the refrigerator either way).
            Actually, you're one of the first that gets to see my own little creation! I've only barely shown it to my
            family and I'm happy that you get this little, very tiny honor also before I go showing others my little monster. </br>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is all very big for me. Considering this will be my career and I will go on to make
            several more, showing off this first one is slightly embarrasing only because I know someone has
            seen me at my worst. Being a slight perfectionist by heart, I hope you understand why I consider you
            to be in a very unique position in my little journey. Still, I'm glad to have you here.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I only started learning programming recently, so this website alone is a huge milestone for me
            that's really proved to me how far I've come. It's done wonders for my motivitation to keep going.
            And obviously, it's all thanks to you!</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm grateful for the kind of professor you've been to us this semester and extremely thankful that
            you made us do this as our project. I do wish that I interacted more in the classes but my shyness on
            Zooms is a powerful thing. Needless to say, I throughly enjoyed your teaching style and doing your
            assignments. Your class was my safe haven from the stress mess that is college. </br>
        </p>
        <p>
           Thank you so much, </br>
        </p>
